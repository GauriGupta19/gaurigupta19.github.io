		Hi! I am currently building my company resear ching post-training data for advancing model capabilities. We are currently in stealth mode and will share more soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before that, most recently I was at <a href='https://parallel.ai' target='_blank'>Parallel</a> (in its very early 10 employees) with <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/paragagr/' target='_blank'>Parag Agrawal</a>, where I built and released our SOTA web <a href='https://parallel.ai/blog/deep-research' target='_blank'>deep-research agents</a> and spent a lot of time understanding agentic architecture and building datasets and evals.
		Prior to that, I was doing my PhD at MIT Media Lab with <a href='https://www.media.mit.edu/people/raskar/overview/' target='_blank'>Prof. Ramesh Raskar</a> on Deep Learning and Foundational Model research where I published a bunch of research in understanding models and data distributions for model training with my amazing collaborators and labmates.
		During my PhD, I had the pleasure to intern at Apple MLR, doing cool research with amazing researchers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kjMNMLkAAAAJ&hl=en'>Navdeep Jaitly</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sv2TGqsAAAAJ&hl=en'>Josh Susskind</a> and <a href='https://bengio.abracadoudou.com/'>Samy Bengio</a> where I mostly worked on text-image diffusion models.
		I decided to drop out of my PhD after a couple years, which was not an easy decision but I realized I wanted to do more industry related product driven research.
	</p>
	<p>
		Prior to MIT, I did my bachelors from India in Mathematics and Computing from IIT Delhi. During my undergrad years, I had been fortunate to pursue research with amazing people and industry labs including Adobe MDSR team, Amazon IML team and <a href='https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/peter-jossenProf'>Peter Jossen</a> at ETH Zurich.
	<p>
		Fun fact: I love travelling and spent ~4 months during my undergrad exchange semester backpacking across Europe, sleeping in trains and living off of bread and neutella :P
